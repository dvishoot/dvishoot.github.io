## Context

We hit the ridge with good weather windows but rising wind. The tradeoffs were all about risk exposure versus progress.

## Notes

- A conservative turn can still be a successful day.
- Wind is the invisible factor you feel in every decision.
- The best trip reports include the why behind every choice.
