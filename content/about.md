I write about two things:

- Engineering work: systems, performance, architecture, the craft.
- Adventures: mountaineering, trip reports, and what the mountains teach.

This site is a long-form notebook: reflective, practical, and occasionally cinematic.

If you’re new here:

- Start with Engineering for systems work, performance notes, and architecture decisions.
- Start with Adventures for trip reports, route notes, and mountain lessons.
